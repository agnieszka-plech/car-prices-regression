<h2> Introduction <span class="tocSkip"></span></h2>

This Jupyter Notebook kernel explores sales of Toyota Corolla cars. The excercise contains various Machine Learning Linear Regression algorithms that have been used to predict the sale price of Toyota Corolla.


<h2> Business Case <span class="tocSkip"></span></h2>


The CEO from Toyota Barcelona has contacted us because they are interested in having a model to predict the prices of different Corolla models that they are selling. 

Right now, they have developed and algorithm that has an error of 50%, so they are not feeling really confident with their results. They have contacted us because they are interested in having a model with better Accuracy. Can you help them?
